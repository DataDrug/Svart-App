# Svart-App

Personal project in which my main goal is to improve the [Keylogger-App](https://github.com/ikenami/Keylogger-App) that I've created.

## What does it do

This application will:
* Set itself to run on startup (when the computer starts);
* Take a screenshot of the window you are interacting with;
* Save in a log file: what you type, in which application are you typing it and when;
* Save the files in a hidden folder;
* Send the screenshots and the log file via mail to a pre-setted mail;
* Delete the files it has just sent;
* Be "invisible" to the user;

## How does it work

Here is how the application is supposed to work. Some of these features hasn't been implemented yet (but it will).

## Personal Comments

Somewhere in the future I might change how some parts of the app works.
